# IMAGPRO-Video-Color-Blind-Simulator

Our color blindness simulator is a  that accurately replicates how people with color vision deficiencies perceive videos. Unlike static image simulations, our simulator provides a comprehensive and immersive experience for understanding colorblindness. It focuses on three main types of color blindness, which are protanomaly, deuteranomaly, and tritanomal. It also simulates in two levels of severity, 0.5 and 1.0. This was developed using the DaltonLens python library and OpenCV.
